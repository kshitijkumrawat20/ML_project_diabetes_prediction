# Diabetes Prediction Projectü©∫

## Project Overview üìù
This project aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning model for predicting diabetes. The problem is framed as a binary classification issue, where the outcome is whether an individual has diabetes. The model uses logistic regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks.

## Inputs ‚å®Ô∏è
The model inputs are critical health metrics, including:
- Pregnancies
- Age
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Insulin
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Skin Thickness

## Process üìà

### 1. Data Gathering
Collect data relevant to the problem. This includes all the input variables necessary for model.

### 2. Descriptive Analysis
Perform a statistical analysis to understand the distribution, count, and basic statistical measures of the data.

### 3. Data Visualizations
Visualize the data to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
Clean and prepare the data for modeling. This includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

### 5. Data Modeling
Implement logistic regression, SVC, Decision Tree classifier, Naive Bayes algorithm to develop the prediction model. Use the training set for this purpose.

### 6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using the test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are considered for evaluation.The best model comes out is Naive bayes model with accuracy upto 76%.

### 7. Model Deployment
Deployed the trained model on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, with a CodePipeline set up between the GitHub repository and Elastic Beanstalk for continuous integration and deployment.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting health outcomes. By following these steps, we can develop a robust model for diabetes prediction using logistic regression.
